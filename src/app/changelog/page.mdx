    <time>19 October, 2024</time>

    ## Small Bug fixes

    This was a minor update, nothing much changed.

    - Added support for disabling the `checkbox-group`, `radio-group` and `button-group` components.
    -   Made the asterisk appear after the group-label in `checkbox-group` when using the `data-required` attribute.
    -   Now the validity of the `checkbox-group` and `radio-group` is based on the `data-invalid` attribute of the group.
    -   **Accordion**:
        -   Now the indicator animation of the accordion item can be disabled by setting the `data-disable-indicator-animation` attribute.
        -   Instead of changing the display property when using the `data-disable-animation` attribute, only disabling the transition effect.
        -   Now the divider after each items can be disabled by setting the `data-show-divider` attribute.
    -   Now you can customize the close icon of the chip.
    -   Now the ripple effect of the card will only trigger when using the `data-pressable` attribute is `true` and `data-disable-ripple` attribute is not set to `true`. But when clicking any clickable elements in the card won't trigger the ripple effect.
