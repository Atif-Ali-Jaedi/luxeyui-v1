## Astro

<Steps>
    <Step heading={"Create an Astro project"}>
        Start by creating a new project using `Astro`.

        ```bash
        npm create astro@latest luxeyui-project
        cd luxeyui-project
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step heading={"install Tailwind CSS and LuxeyUI"}>
        Run the `astro add` command to install both `tailwindcss` and `@astro/tailwind` as well as generate a `tailwind.config.cjs` file.

        ```bash
        npx astro add tailwind
        ```

        And then install LuxeyUI:

        ```bash
        npm i luxeyui@latest
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step heading={"Import the files provided by LuxeyUI"}>
        In your main layout file, `src/layouts/Layout.astro`, import the css file at the top of the file:

        ```js
        import "./node_modules/luxeyui/dist/index.css";
        ```

        Now you'll also need to import the `js` file before the end of the `body` tag with the `client:only` directive.

        ```html
        <script client:only>
            import "./node_modules/luxeyui/dist/index.js";
        </script>
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step heading={"That is it"}>
        Now you can start your designing using components with full functionality. Also you can use other libraries or frameworks like react with it. For instance:

        ```jsx
        export const Button = ({ className, children, ...props }) => {
          return (
            <button className={`button ${className}`} {...props}>{children}</button>
          )
        }
        ```
    </Step>
</Steps>
